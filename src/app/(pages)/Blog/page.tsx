							As I reflect on my journey, I am humbled to share
							the story of how I transitioned from the world of
							architecture to the realm of entrepreneurship,
							guided by a fervor for innovation and a relentless
							pursuit of impactful solutions. My name is Morteza
							Maddahi, and my evolution from a designer in
							Architecture office to a tech entrepreneur has been
							a transformative experience. My journey took a
							significant turn after 2015 when I felt a stirring
							within me to explore my entrepreneurial spirit. It
							was during this time that I embarked on a venture to
							create a startup called &quot;Zelt.&quot; The vision
							behind Zelt was to develop a software solution that
							would empower architects to seamlessly navigate
							building codes and regulations in real-time through
							their 3D model designs. Although my time in Boston
							nurturing this idea was invaluable, my path
							eventually led me to Seattle, where I embarked on a
							new chapter alongside my wife, who is a dedicated
							family physician. Inspired by my wife&#39;s
							unwavering commitment to healthcare and the profound
							impact she has on her patients, I found myself drawn
							to the healthcare industry. Fuelled by a desire to
							contribute meaningfully to this space, I set out to
							create a project that would change the way doctors
							communicate and manage their workflows. Thus,
							&quot;Docktorly&quote; was born—a communication and
							management app tailored to the unique needs of
							medical professionals. The journey of bringing
							Docktorly to life has been nothing short of
							exhilarating. With a team of talented and trusted
							developers by my side, we have poured our hearts and
							minds into crafting a solution that resonates with
							the medical community. The feedback we have received
							from doctors has been overwhelmingly positive,
							serving as a testament to the relevance and impact
							of our work. As I continue to navigate the intricate
							landscape of entrepreneurship, I am reminded of the
							power of passion, perseverance, and collaboration.
							Every setback has been a lesson, every success a
							source of inspiration. I am committed to fostering
							innovation, driving positive change, and creating
							solutions that empower individuals in their
							respective fields. In closing, I am immensely
							grateful for the journey that has brought me to this
							point—a journey marked by curiosity, resilience, and
							an unwavering belief in the transformative power of
							ideas. I look forward to the road ahead, filled with
							new challenges, opportunities, and the promise of
							making a difference in the lives of those we seek to
							serve. With humility and gratitude, Morteza
							Maddahiule, working as much or as little as they
