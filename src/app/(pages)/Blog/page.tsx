					As I reflect on my journey, I am humbled to share the story
					of how I transitioned from the world of architecture to the
					realm of entrepreneurship, guided by a fervor for innovation
					and a relentless pursuit of impactful solutions. My name is
					Morteza Maddahi, and my evolution from a designer in Architecture office to a tech entrepreneur has been a transformative experience.
					My journey took a significant turn after 2015 when I felt a
					stirring within me to explore my entrepreneurial spirit. It
					was during this time that I embarked on a venture to create
					a startup called &quot;Zelt.&quot; The vision behind Zelt was to
					develop a software solution that would empower architects to
					seamlessly navigate building codes and regulations in
					real-time through their 3D model designs. Although my time
					in Boston nurturing this idea was invaluable, my path
					eventually led me to Seattle, where I embarked on a new
					chapter alongside my wife, who is a dedicated family
					physician. Inspired by my wife&#39;s unwavering commitment to
					healthcare and the profound impact she has on her patients,
					I found myself drawn to the healthcare industry. Fuelled by
					a desire to contribute meaningfully to this space, I set out
					to create a project that would change the way doctors
					communicate and manage their workflows. Thus, &quot;Docktorly&quote;
					was born—a communication and management app
					tailored to the unique needs of medical professionals. The
					journey of bringing Docktorly to life has been nothing short
					of exhilarating. With a team of talented and trusted
					developers by my side, we have poured our hearts and minds
					into crafting a solution that resonates with the medical
					community. The feedback we have received from doctors has
					been overwhelmingly positive, serving as a testament to the
					relevance and impact of our work. As I continue to navigate
					the intricate landscape of entrepreneurship, I am reminded
					of the power of passion, perseverance, and collaboration.
					Every setback has been a lesson, every success a source of
					inspiration. I am committed to fostering innovation, driving
					positive change, and creating solutions that empower
					individuals in their respective fields. In closing, I am
					immensely grateful for the journey that has brought me to
					this point—a journey marked by curiosity, resilience, and an
					unwavering belief in the transformative power of ideas. I
					look forward to the road ahead, filled with new challenges,
					opportunities, and the promise of making a difference in the
					lives of those we seek to serve.
					
					With humility and
					gratitude, Morteza Maddahi
